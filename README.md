# Community Store File Uploads

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

Provides a block for customers to upload files for their order. A notification email sends to the store administration when used.

### Usage

Place the 'File Upload' block on:
- the order complete page
- another hidden page on your site

Then, against products, check 'File Upload' attribute checkbox when you wish a customer to upload a file when purchasing.
There is also a 'File Upload Label' attribute against products to customise the label shown to customers.

The block can also be configured to allow searching for an order to upload files against, searching by order number and email.
This configuration can be used if you wish to allow a customer to re-upload files at a last time - a URL to a hidden page with this block can be sent to the customer.
